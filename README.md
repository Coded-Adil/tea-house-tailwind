# Project Title: Tea-House

I made a simple responsive Cafe website. I built this website to practice my newly learned Tailwind CSS skills.

# Live Link:

# Technologies Used:

    Tailwind CSS 

# Features:

- Attractive Banner Section: A visually appealing banner section to grab attention.

- Attractive Client Review Section: An unique and responsive Design for review section

- Fully Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices.

# Challenges:

The main challenge in this project was to make the review section. However, after spending some time learning and experimenting, I was able to make it work. It was really fun to learn about Tailwind CSS.
